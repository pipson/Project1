strategy:

1. create array and fill with letters.

2. create a function that will shuffle the array from underscore.js.

3. create a new board which will create child divs as specified in css and populate it 
automatically in a for loop as per the tile id and values from the array and user clicking initiates the flip function.

4. create a memoryFlipTile function.

5. Inside the memoryFlipTile function check if the clicked tile is empty and the value less than 2.

6.once the user click the first card, push the tileid and the value to an empty array.

7.The user click on the second tile do the same thing.

8. if the first push and the second push is the same the tilesflipped will be 2.

9.empty the tileid and value of array then.

10.if tiles flipped is equal to the length of the array, clear the board using a prompt.

11.if the match is not the same then flip back.

12. set the timer so that the tile flips back if the tileid and value of both the pick is not the same.
